
Need to define a "Core" interface to 
    1. de-couple emulator and MT 
    2. support multiple types of platform by plugin -- I don't know what you really are but I know you can do something
    3. restrict developement of emulation core
    4. can be different look-like (interface) for different MT components:
        such as if one core support inspectable and then MT inspect component will trade it as an inspectable instance

A "Core" cares these aspects:
    1. Algorithm -- cpu-like component
    2. Graphics  -- gpu-like component
    3. Audio     -- apu-like component
    4. Storage   -- mem rom disk image data -like component
    5. Controll  -- joystick-like  component

    Other:

    Inspectable -- can decide what to watch, what to see
        mem address
        event
        
        so the inspect line can be : 
        address -> value -> event
        address varname support, address cascade support 
        trigger condition support, enable / disable support 


Need to build MT for Integrate core function into platform fuinction 

Call a Core + MT + facade = Cell

Question 
    1. 异构的板子怎么办
    2. where to put the cache trick for images / records
    3. how to define the method to inspect
        

Cores will not exist in src folders but independently exist in other area, this will help developing core itself relatively independent and keep it small
